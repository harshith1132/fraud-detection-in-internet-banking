 Fraud Detection in Internet Banking Using Machine Learning

Banking fraud transactions refer to unauthorized or deceptive activities involving bank accounts or 
financial transactions. Various machine learning algorithms can be employed to detect such fraudulent activities. This 
study examines several algorithms suitable for classifying transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The research 
utilizes the Banking Fraud Transactions dataset, which is often characterized by high imbalance. To address this issue, 
we are implementing multiple machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Decision 
Tree. Additionally, feature selection techniques are employed, and the dataset is divided into training and test sets. The 
algorithms evaluated in the study include Random Forest, and KNN. The findings indicate that each algorithm 
demonstrates high accuracy in detecting banking fraud transactions. The proposed model holds promise for detecting 
other irregularities within financial transactions.
